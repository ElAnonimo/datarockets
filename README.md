### Splitter

Welcome to Splitter an app that helps you and your crowd to split the bill and keep the relations cohesive. It doesn't come with a manual since it's only a few inputs to deal with. Fill 'em in and see the calculus magic happening for you. To zero out the tip value click the tip chip again.

Please install the deps first before you run it. To get it on the screen run `npm run start` then visit http://localhost:3000/.

The app was built primarily for 1080 or 360 px screens. Please forgive if yours doesn't fit.
